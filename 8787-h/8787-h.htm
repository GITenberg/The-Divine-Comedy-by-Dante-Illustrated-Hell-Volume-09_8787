<h2>CANTO XXIX</h2>
<br>

<p>SO were mine eyes inebriate with view<br>
Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds<br>
Disfigur'd, that they long'd to stay and weep.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/29-269.jpg"><img alt="29-269b.jpg (47K)" src="images/29-269b.jpg" height="548" width="352"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>But Virgil rous'd me: "What yet gazest on?<br>
Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below<br>
Among the maim'd and miserable shades?<br>
Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside<br>
This weakness. &nbsp;Know, if thou wouldst number them<br>
That two and twenty miles the valley winds<br>
Its circuit, and already is the moon<br>
Beneath our feet: the time permitted now<br>
Is short, and more not seen remains to see."<br>
<br>"If thou," I straight replied, "hadst weigh'd the cause<br>
For which I look'd, thou hadst perchance excus'd<br>
The tarrying still." &nbsp;My leader part pursu'd<br>
His way, the while I follow'd, answering him,<br>
And adding thus: "Within that cave I deem,<br>
Whereon so fixedly I held my ken,<br>
There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,<br>
Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear."<br>
<br>Then spake my master: "Let thy soul no more<br>
Afflict itself for him. &nbsp;Direct elsewhere<br>
Its thought, and leave him. &nbsp;At the bridge's foot<br>
I mark'd how he did point with menacing look<br>
At thee, and heard him by the others nam'd<br>
Geri of Bello. &nbsp;Thou so wholly then<br>
Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul'd<br>
The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not<br>
That way, ere he was gone."&mdash;"O guide belov'd!<br>
His violent death yet unaveng'd," said I,<br>
"By any, who are partners in his shame,<br>
Made him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,<br>
He pass'd me speechless by; and doing so<br>
Hath made me more compassionate his fate."<br>
<br>So we discours'd to where the rock first show'd<br>
The other valley, had more light been there,<br>
E'en to the lowest depth. &nbsp;Soon as we came<br>
O'er the last cloister in the dismal rounds<br>
Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood<br>
Were to our view expos'd, then many a dart<br>
Of sore lament assail'd me, headed all<br>
With points of thrilling pity, that I clos'd<br>
Both ears against the volley with mine hands.<br>
<br>As were the torment, if each lazar-house<br>
Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time<br>
'Twixt July and September, with the isle<br>
Sardinia and Maremma's pestilent fen,<br>
Had heap'd their maladies all in one foss<br>
Together; such was here the torment: dire<br>
The stench, as issuing steams from fester'd limbs.<br>
<br>We on the utmost shore of the long rock<br>
Descended still to leftward. &nbsp;Then my sight<br>
Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein<br>
The minister of the most mighty Lord,<br>
All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment<br>
The forgers noted on her dread record.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/29-273.jpg"><img alt="29-273b.jpg (50K)" src="images/29-273b.jpg" height="564" width="356"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>More rueful was it not methinks to see<br>
The nation in Aegina droop, what time<br>
Each living thing, e'en to the little worm,<br>
All fell, so full of malice was the air<br>
(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,<br>
The ancient people were restor'd anew<br>
From seed of emmets) than was here to see<br>
The spirits, that languish'd through the murky vale<br>
Up-pil'd on many a stack. &nbsp;Confus'd they lay,<br>
One o'er the belly, o'er the shoulders one<br>
Roll'd of another; sideling crawl'd a third<br>
Along the dismal pathway. &nbsp;Step by step<br>
We journey'd on, in silence looking round<br>
And list'ning those diseas'd, who strove in vain<br>
To lift their forms. &nbsp;Then two I mark'd, that sat<br>
Propp'd 'gainst each other, as two brazen pans<br>
Set to retain the heat. &nbsp;From head to foot,<br>
A tetter bark'd them round. Nor saw I e'er<br>
Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord<br>
Impatient waited, or himself perchance<br>
Tir'd with long watching, as of these each one<br>
Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness<br>
Of ne'er abated pruriency. &nbsp;The crust<br>
Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales<br>
Scrap'd from the bream or fish of broader mail.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/29-275.jpg"><img alt="29-275b.jpg (63K)" src="images/29-275b.jpg" height="406" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off<br>
Thy coat of proof," thus spake my guide to one,<br>
"And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,<br>
Tell me if any born of Latian land<br>
Be among these within: so may thy nails<br>
Serve thee for everlasting to this toil."<br>
<br>"Both are of Latium," weeping he replied,<br>
"Whom tortur'd thus thou seest: but who art thou<br>
That hast inquir'd of us?" &nbsp;To whom my guide:<br>
"One that descend with this man, who yet lives,<br>
From rock to rock, and show him hell's abyss."<br>
<br>Then started they asunder, and each turn'd<br>
Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear<br>
Those words redounding struck. &nbsp;To me my liege<br>
Address'd him: "Speak to them whate'er thou list."<br>
<br>And I therewith began: "So may no time<br>
Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men<br>
In th' upper world, but after many suns<br>
Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,<br>
And of what race ye come. &nbsp;Your punishment,<br>
Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,<br>
Deter you not from opening thus much to me."<br>
<br>"Arezzo was my dwelling," answer'd one,<br>
"And me Albero of Sienna brought<br>
To die by fire; but that, for which I died,<br>
Leads me not here. &nbsp;True is in sport I told him,<br>
That I had learn'd to wing my flight in air.<br>
And he admiring much, as he was void<br>
Of wisdom, will'd me to declare to him<br>
The secret of mine art: and only hence,<br>
Because I made him not a Daedalus,<br>
Prevail'd on one suppos'd his sire to burn me.<br>
But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,<br>
For that I practis'd alchemy on earth,<br>
Has doom'd me. &nbsp;Him no subterfuge eludes."<br>
<br>Then to the bard I spake: "Was ever race<br>
Light as Sienna's? &nbsp;Sure not France herself<br>
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain."<br>
<br>The other leprous spirit heard my words,<br>
And thus return'd: "Be Stricca from this charge<br>
Exempted, he who knew so temp'rately<br>
To lay out fortune's gifts; and Niccolo<br>
Who first the spice's costly luxury<br>
Discover'd in that garden, where such seed<br>
Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop<br>
Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano<br>
Lavish'd his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,<br>
And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show'd<br>
A spectacle for all. &nbsp;That thou mayst know<br>
Who seconds thee against the Siennese<br>
Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen'd sight,<br>
That well my face may answer to thy ken;<br>
So shalt thou see I am Capocchio's ghost,<br>
Who forg'd transmuted metals by the power<br>
Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,<br>
Thus needs must well remember how I aped<br>
Creative nature by my subtle art."</p>

<h2>CANTO XXX</h2>
<br>

<p>WHAT time resentment burn'd in Juno's breast<br>
For Semele against the Theban blood,<br>
As more than once in dire mischance was rued,<br>
Such fatal frenzy seiz'd on Athamas,<br>
That he his spouse beholding with a babe<br>
Laden on either arm, "Spread out," he cried,<br>
"The meshes, that I take the lioness<br>
And the young lions at the pass:" then forth<br>
Stretch'd he his merciless talons, grasping one,<br>
One helpless innocent, Learchus nam'd,<br>
Whom swinging down he dash'd upon a rock,<br>
And with her other burden self-destroy'd<br>
The hapless mother plung'd: and when the pride<br>
Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,<br>
By fortune overwhelm'd, and the old king<br>
With his realm perish'd, then did Hecuba,<br>
A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw<br>
Polyxena first slaughter'd, and her son,<br>
Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach<br>
Next met the mourner's view, then reft of sense<br>
Did she run barking even as a dog;<br>
Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul.<br>
Bet ne'er the Furies or of Thebes or Troy<br>
With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads<br>
Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,<br>
As now two pale and naked ghost I saw<br>
That gnarling wildly scamper'd, like the swine<br>
Excluded from his stye. &nbsp;One reach'd Capocchio,<br>
And in the neck-joint sticking deep his fangs,<br>
Dragg'd him, that o'er the solid pavement rubb'd<br>
His belly stretch'd out prone. &nbsp;The other shape,<br>
He of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;<br>
"That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood<br>
Of random mischief vent he still his spite."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/30-281.jpg"><img alt="30-281b.jpg (62K)" src="images/30-281b.jpg" height="402" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>To whom I answ'ring: "Oh! as thou dost hope,<br>
The other may not flesh its jaws on thee,<br>
Be patient to inform us, who it is,<br>
Ere it speed hence."&mdash;"That is the ancient soul<br>
Of wretched Myrrha," he replied, "who burn'd<br>
With most unholy flame for her own sire,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/30-283.jpg"><img alt="30-283b.jpg (46K)" src="images/30-283b.jpg" height="537" width="352"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"And a false shape assuming, so perform'd<br>
The deed of sin; e'en as the other there,<br>
That onward passes, dar'd to counterfeit<br>
Donati's features, to feign'd testament<br>
The seal affixing, that himself might gain,<br>
For his own share, the lady of the herd."<br>
<br>When vanish'd the two furious shades, on whom<br>
Mine eye was held, I turn'd it back to view<br>
The other cursed spirits. &nbsp;One I saw<br>
In fashion like a lute, had but the groin<br>
Been sever'd, where it meets the forked part.<br>
Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs<br>
With ill-converted moisture, that the paunch<br>
Suits not the visage, open'd wide his lips<br>
Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,<br>
One towards the chin, the other upward curl'd.<br>
<br>"O ye, who in this world of misery,<br>
Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,"<br>
Thus he began, "attentively regard<br>
Adamo's woe. &nbsp;When living, full supply<br>
Ne'er lack'd me of what most I coveted;<br>
One drop of water now, alas! I crave.<br>
The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes<br>
Of Casentino, making fresh and soft<br>
The banks whereby they glide to Arno's stream,<br>
Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;<br>
For more the pictur'd semblance dries me up,<br>
Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh<br>
Desert these shrivel'd cheeks. &nbsp;So from the place,<br>
Where I transgress'd, stern justice urging me,<br>
Takes means to quicken more my lab'ring sighs.<br>
There is Romena, where I falsified<br>
The metal with the Baptist's form imprest,<br>
For which on earth I left my body burnt.<br>
But if I here might see the sorrowing soul<br>
Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,<br>
For Branda's limpid spring I would not change<br>
The welcome sight. &nbsp;One is e'en now within,<br>
If truly the mad spirits tell, that round<br>
Are wand'ring. &nbsp;But wherein besteads me that?<br>
My limbs are fetter'd. &nbsp;Were I but so light,<br>
That I each hundred years might move one inch,<br>
I had set forth already on this path,<br>
Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,<br>
Although eleven miles it wind, not more<br>
Than half of one across. &nbsp;They brought me down<br>
Among this tribe; induc'd by them I stamp'd<br>
The florens with three carats of alloy."<br>
<br>"Who are that abject pair," I next inquir'd,<br>
"That closely bounding thee upon thy right<br>
Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep'd<br>
In the chill stream?"&mdash;"When to this gulf I dropt,"<br>
He answer'd, "here I found them; since that hour<br>
They have not turn'd, nor ever shall, I ween,<br>
Till time hath run his course. &nbsp;One is that dame<br>
The false accuser of the Hebrew youth;<br>
Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy.<br>
Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,<br>
In such a cloud upsteam'd." &nbsp;When that he heard,<br>
One, gall'd perchance to be so darkly nam'd,<br>
With clench'd hand smote him on the braced paunch,<br>
That like a drum resounded: but forthwith<br>
Adamo smote him on the face, the blow<br>
Returning with his arm, that seem'd as hard.<br>
<br>"Though my o'erweighty limbs have ta'en from me<br>
The power to move," said he, "I have an arm<br>
At liberty for such employ." &nbsp;To whom<br>
Was answer'd: "When thou wentest to the fire,<br>
Thou hadst it not so ready at command,<br>
Then readier when it coin'd th' impostor gold."<br>
<br>And thus the dropsied: "Ay, now speak'st thou true.<br>
But there thou gav'st not such true testimony,<br>
When thou wast question'd of the truth, at Troy."<br>
<br>"If I spake false, thou falsely stamp'dst the coin,"<br>
Said Sinon; "I am here but for one fault,<br>
And thou for more than any imp beside."<br>
<br>"Remember," he replied, "O perjur'd one,<br>
The horse remember, that did teem with death,<br>
And all the world be witness to thy guilt."<br>
<br>"To thine," return'd the Greek, "witness the thirst<br>
Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,<br>
Rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes,<br>
A mass corrupt." &nbsp;To whom the coiner thus:<br>
"Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass<br>
Its evil saying. &nbsp;Me if thirst assails,<br>
Yet I am stuff'd with moisture. &nbsp;Thou art parch'd,<br>
Pains rack thy head, no urging would'st thou need<br>
To make thee lap Narcissus' mirror up."<br>
<br>I was all fix'd to listen, when my guide<br>
Admonish'd: "Now beware: a little more.<br>
And I do quarrel with thee." &nbsp;I perceiv'd<br>
How angrily he spake, and towards him turn'd<br>
With shame so poignant, as remember'd yet<br>
Confounds me. &nbsp;As a man that dreams of harm<br>
Befall'n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,<br>
And that which is, desires as if it were not,<br>
Such then was I, who wanting power to speak<br>
Wish'd to excuse myself, and all the while<br>
Excus'd me, though unweeting that I did.<br>
<br>"More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,"<br>
My master cried, "might expiate. &nbsp;Therefore cast<br>
All sorrow from thy soul; and if again<br>
Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,<br>
Think I am ever at thy side. &nbsp;To hear<br>
Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="31"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXXI</h2>
<br>

<p>THE very tongue, whose keen reproof before<br>
Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain'd,<br>
Now minister'd my cure. &nbsp;So have I heard,<br>
Achilles and his father's javelin caus'd<br>
Pain first, and then the boon of health restor'd.<br>
<br>Turning our back upon the vale of woe,<br>
W cross'd th' encircled mound in silence. &nbsp;There<br>
Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom<br>
Mine eye advanc'd not: but I heard a horn<br>
Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made<br>
The thunder feeble. &nbsp;Following its course<br>
The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent<br>
On that one spot. &nbsp;So terrible a blast<br>
Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout<br>
O'erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench'd<br>
His saintly warfare. &nbsp;Thitherward not long<br>
My head was rais'd, when many lofty towers<br>
Methought I spied. &nbsp;"Master," said I, "what land<br>
Is this?" &nbsp;He answer'd straight: "Too long a space<br>
Of intervening darkness has thine eye<br>
To traverse: thou hast therefore widely err'd<br>
In thy imagining. &nbsp;Thither arriv'd<br>
Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude<br>
The sense. &nbsp;A little therefore urge thee on."<br>
<br>Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;<br>
"Yet know," said he, "ere farther we advance,<br>
That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,<br>
But giants. &nbsp;In the pit they stand immers'd,<br>
Each from his navel downward, round the bank."<br>
<br>As when a fog disperseth gradually,<br>
Our vision traces what the mist involves<br>
Condens'd in air; so piercing through the gross<br>
And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more<br>
We near'd toward the brink, mine error fled,<br>
And fear came o'er me. &nbsp;As with circling round<br>
Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,<br>
E'en thus the shore, encompassing th' abyss,<br>
Was turreted with giants, half their length<br>
Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav'n<br>
Yet threatens, when his mutt'ring thunder rolls.<br>
<br>Of one already I descried the face,<br>
Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge<br>
Great part, and both arms down along his ribs.<br>
<br>All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand<br>
Left framing of these monsters, did display<br>
Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War<br>
Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she<br>
Repent her not of th' elephant and whale,<br>
Who ponders well confesses her therein<br>
Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force<br>
And evil will are back'd with subtlety,<br>
Resistance none avails. &nbsp;His visage seem'd<br>
In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops<br>
Saint Peter's Roman fane; and th' other bones<br>
Of like proportion, so that from above<br>
The bank, which girdled him below, such height<br>
Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders<br>
Had striv'n in vain to reach but to his hair.<br>
Full thirty ample palms was he expos'd<br>
Downward from whence a man his garments loops.<br>
"Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,"<br>
So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns<br>
Became not; and my guide address'd him thus:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/31-291.jpg"><img alt="31-291b.jpg (47K)" src="images/31-291b.jpg" height="556" width="352"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee<br>
Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage<br>
Or other passion wring thee. &nbsp;Search thy neck,<br>
There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.<br>
Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast<br>
Where hangs the baldrick!" &nbsp;Then to me he spake:<br>
"He doth accuse himself. &nbsp;Nimrod is this,<br>
Through whose ill counsel in the world no more<br>
One tongue prevails. &nbsp;But pass we on, nor waste<br>
Our words; for so each language is to him,<br>
As his to others, understood by none."<br>
<br>Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,<br>
And at a sling's throw found another shade<br>
Far fiercer and more huge. &nbsp;I cannot say<br>
What master hand had girt him; but he held<br>
Behind the right arm fetter'd, and before<br>
The other with a chain, that fasten'd him<br>
From the neck down, and five times round his form<br>
Apparent met the wreathed links. &nbsp;"This proud one<br>
Would of his strength against almighty Jove<br>
Make trial," said my guide; "whence he is thus<br>
Requited: Ephialtes him they call.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/31-293.jpg"><img alt="31-293b.jpg (53K)" src="images/31-293b.jpg" height="410" width="496"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Great was his prowess, when the giants brought<br>
Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,<br>
Now moves he never." &nbsp;Forthwith I return'd:<br>
"Fain would I, if 't were possible, mine eyes<br>
Of Briareus immeasurable gain'd<br>
Experience next." &nbsp;He answer'd: "Thou shalt see<br>
Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks<br>
And is unfetter'd, who shall place us there<br>
Where guilt is at its depth. &nbsp;Far onward stands<br>
Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made<br>
Like to this spirit, save that in his looks<br>
More fell he seems." &nbsp;By violent earthquake rock'd<br>
Ne'er shook a tow'r, so reeling to its base,<br>
As Ephialtes. &nbsp;More than ever then<br>
I dreaded death, nor than the terror more<br>
Had needed, if I had not seen the cords<br>
That held him fast. &nbsp;We, straightway journeying on,<br>
Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete<br>
Without the head, forth issued from the cave.<br>
<br>"O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made<br>
Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword<br>
Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,<br>
Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil<br>
An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought<br>
In the high conflict on thy brethren's side,<br>
Seems as men yet believ'd, that through thine arm<br>
The sons of earth had conquer'd, now vouchsafe<br>
To place us down beneath, where numbing cold<br>
Locks up Cocytus. &nbsp;Force not that we crave<br>
Or Tityus' help or Typhon's. &nbsp;Here is one<br>
Can give what in this realm ye covet. &nbsp;Stoop<br>
Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip.<br>
He in the upper world can yet bestow<br>
Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks<br>
For life yet longer, if before the time<br>
Grace call him not unto herself." &nbsp;Thus spake<br>
The teacher. &nbsp;He in haste forth stretch'd his hands,<br>
And caught my guide. &nbsp;Alcides whilom felt<br>
That grapple straighten'd score. &nbsp;Soon as my guide<br>
Had felt it, he bespake me thus: "This way<br>
That I may clasp thee;" then so caught me up,<br>
That we were both one burden. &nbsp;As appears<br>
The tower of Carisenda, from beneath<br>
Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud<br>
So sail across, that opposite it hangs,<br>
Such then Antaeus seem'd, as at mine ease<br>
I mark'd him stooping. &nbsp;I were fain at times<br>
T' have pass'd another way. &nbsp;Yet in th' abyss,<br>
That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,<br>
lightly he plac'd us; nor there leaning stay'd,<br>
But rose as in a bark the stately mast.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
